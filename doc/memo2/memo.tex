\section{Summary}
% I want to tell Skip that...
The Nuclear Data Access Tool Kit, which provides continuous energy
libraries corresponding to multigroup libraries, has been updated with
the addition of new photon (\texttt{mcplib84}, \texttt{e68g\_103}) and
neutron (\texttt{mendf71x}) transport libraries.  The code library and
continuous energy neutron and photon data libraries are available on
the open and secure X-LAN, open and secure HPC network, and
Livermore's Sequoia and Zin computers.

\section{Background}

On November 13, 2014 I released the first production version (1.0.0)
of the Nuclear Data Access Tool Kit\cite{gray14} (\ndatk) on LANL and
LLNL platforms for use by the Monte Carlo Application Tool
Kit\cite{adams14} (\MCATK) team and its users.  The release included
libraries to match the \texttt{lanl2006}\cite{white07} multigroup
library, \texttt{endf71x}\cite{conlin13} continuous energy library,
and a subset\cite{lee13} of the tables corresponding to the
\texttt{mtmg08}\cite{white09} multigroup library.

This memo describes the subsequent addition of the continuous energy
\texttt{mendf71x} neutron and \texttt{mcplib84} and \texttt{e68g\_103}
photon transport libraries.
libraries to \ndatk.
\newpage

\section{Discussion}

On March 13, 2015 I added the \texttt{mcplib84} and \texttt{e68g\_103}
continuous energy photon transport libraries to \ndatk.  The
\texttt{mcplib84} library is a direct copy of \MCNP's
\texttt{mcplib84}\cite{white12} with 100 elemental tables.  The
\texttt{e68g\_103} library adds 423 isotopic SZAs from
\texttt{endf71x} pointing to the elemental tables of \texttt{mcplib84}
to create a library corresponding to \NDI's
\texttt{e68g\_103}\cite{white05} multigroup photon transport library.
The use of the \texttt{endf71x} isotope SZAs in \texttt{e68g\_103}
ensures compatibility with \NDI's SZA resolution for photons and with
all continuous energy neutron transport libraries currently in or
planned for \ndatk.

On May 18, 2015 I added the \texttt{mendf71x} continuous energy
neutron transport library to \ndatk.  The \texttt{mendf71x} library
adds the fission products 45117.90c and 46119.90c from \ndatk's
\texttt{lanl2006} library, and 33073.71c from the \ndatk's upcoming
\texttt{mt71x} library to create a library corresponding to \NDI's
\texttt{mendf71x}\cite{lee14} multigroup neutron transport library.

Table~\ref{tbl:data} summarizes the libraries available in \ndatk.

\section{Conclusion}

The Nuclear Data Access Tool Kit, which provides continuous energy
libraries corresponding to multigroup libraries, has been updated
with the addition of new photon and neutron libraries.  The
code library, \texttt{lanl2006}, \texttt{endf71x}, \texttt{mtmg08} and
\texttt{mendf71x} continuous energy neutron data libraries, and
\texttt{mcplib84} and \texttt{e68g\_103} continuous energy photon data
libraries are available on the open and secure X-LAN, open and secure
HPC network, and on Livermore's Sequoia and Zin computers.

The ease with which the libraries were created and release updated,
once the required tables were identified, is a testament to the sound
design of \ndatk.  The policy on how production data is released, how
special data is handled, and the relation between code and data
releases has yet to be worked out.

We anticipate the release of new \ndatk\ code and data
(\texttt{mt71x}) libraries coincident with the release of new
\NDI\ code and data (\texttt{mt71x}) libraries at the end of FY15.
